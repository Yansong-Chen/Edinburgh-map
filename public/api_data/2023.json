A thought-provoking show about men dealing with toxic masculinity and women dealing with men. Through interviews with male-identifying individuals and personal stories, the show vividly portrays the pain of not fitting in, the thrill of finding one's strength, the shame of misusing it, and the sorrow of not knowing how to cry. Powerfully performed by four women from Iceland and Finland, Them challenges audiences to question their own preconceptions and consider how we can work towards a world where everyone has the right to be themselves.","description_teaser":null,"artist":"From Start to Finnish in association with Spindrift Theatre","artist_type":"Professional company","genre":"Theatre","genre_tags":"Physical theatre","categories":{"strand_titles":[],"subjects":[],"keywords":[]},"discounts":{"two_for_one":true,"group":true,"friends":false,"passport":false,"schools":false},"disabled":{"audio":false,"audio_dates":null,"signed":false,"signed_dates":null,"captioning":false,"captioning_dates":null,"other_services":true,"other_services_dates":"2023-08-16","other_services_information":"Relaxed performance"},"age_category":"16+","website":"https:\/\/www.edfringe.com\/event\/2023THEM_PV","images":{"6046fb1c89873c2b667318bf5d9920a8c846c0e9":{"hash":"6046fb1c89873c2b667318bf5d9920a8c846c0e9","type":"thumb","orientation":"square","versions":{"original":{"type":"original","width":250,"height":250,"mime":"image\/jpeg","url":"\/\/images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com\/60\/46\/fb\/6046fb1c89873c2b667318bf5d9920a8c846c0e9-original"},"square-75":{"type":"square-75","width":75,"height":75,"mime":"image\/jpeg","url":"\/\/images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com\/60\/46\/fb\/6046fb1c89873c2b667318bf5d9920a8c846c0e9-square-75.jpg"},"square-150":{"type":"square-150","width":150,"height":150,"mime":"image\/jpeg","url":"\/\/images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com\/60\/46\/fb\/6046fb1c89873c2b667318bf5d9920a8c846c0e9-square-150.jpg"},"thumb-100":{"type":"thumb-100","width":100,"height":100,"mime":"image\/jpeg","url":"\/\/images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com\/60\/46\/fb\/6046fb1c89873c2b667318bf5d9920a8c846c0e9-thumb-100.jpg"}}}},"twitter":"@spindriftheatre","country":"FINLAND","performers_number":4,"non_english":null,"related_content":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@spindrifttheatre"},{"url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/796806048"},{"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/SpindriftTheatre"}],"festival":"Edinburgh Festival Fringe","url":"https:\/\/api.edinburghfestivalcity.com\/events\/6761595fae8ec997e1a869939f98fb4341f7b4a3","updated":"2023-08-15 08:45:36","update_times":{"identity":1683798023,"title":1683798023,"description":1683798023,"venue":1683798023,"performances":1692085536,"artist":1683798023,"genre":1683798023,"discounts":1683798023,"age_category":1683798023,"fringe_first":1683798023,"other":1683798023,"disabled":1683798023,"web_links":1688657774,"images":1683798023,"status":1683798023},"latitude":55.946018,"longitude":-3.18841},{"festival_id":"fringe","title":"Laura Ramoso: FRANCES","sub_title":null,"status":"active","code":"2023LAURARA_PC","year":2023,"venue":{"name":"Pleasance Courtyard","map_ref":null,"code":"33","description":"The Pleasance\u2019s famous cobblestone Courtyard has been entertaining festival audiences since 1985 and is considered by many to be the very heart of the Fringe.
