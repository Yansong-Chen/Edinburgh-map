And after all that, the only thing left is to dance. \u2018It is always reassuring to see a student-age company wittily trashing the junk culture fed to them\u2019 **** (Times). \u2018Fill the stage with wonder and worry\u2019 **** (BritishTheatreGuide.com).\r\n","description_teaser":null,"artist":"Square Pegs \u2013 Macready Theatre Young Actors' Company","artist_type":"Student\/Youth company","genre":"Theatre","genre_tags":"Contemporary,Comedy","categories":{"strand_titles":[],"subjects":[],"keywords":[]},"discounts":{"two_for_one":true,"group":true,"friends":true,"passport":false,"schools":false},"disabled":{"audio":false,"audio_dates":null,"signed":false,"signed_dates":null,"captioning":false,"captioning_dates":null,"other_services":false,"other_services_dates":null,"other_services_information":null},"age_category":"12+","website":"https:\/\/www.edfringe.com\/event\/20227SEVENT_ATB","images":{"164e76b08fd2b5adb91b1bc1fd38f4ba1be21fe0":{"hash":"164e76b08fd2b5adb91b1bc1fd38f4ba1be21fe0","type":"thumb","orientation":"square","versions":{"original":{"type":"original","width":250,"height":250,"mime":"image\/jpeg","url":"\/\/images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com\/16\/4e\/76\/164e76b08fd2b5adb91b1bc1fd38f4ba1be21fe0-original"},"square-75":{"type":"square-75","width":75,"height":75,"mime":"image\/jpeg","url":"\/\/images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com\/16\/4e\/76\/164e76b08fd2b5adb91b1bc1fd38f4ba1be21fe0-square-75.jpg"},"square-150":{"type":"square-150","width":150,"height":150,"mime":"image\/jpeg","url":"\/\/images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com\/16\/4e\/76\/164e76b08fd2b5adb91b1bc1fd38f4ba1be21fe0-square-150.jpg"},"thumb-100":{"type":"thumb-100","width":100,"height":100,"mime":"image\/jpeg","url":"\/\/images.api.edinburghfestivalcity.com\/16\/4e\/76\/164e76b08fd2b5adb91b1bc1fd38f4ba1be21fe0-thumb-100.jpg"}}}},"twitter":null,"country":"UNITED KINGDOM - ENGLAND","performers_number":8,"non_english":null,"festival":"Edinburgh Festival Fringe","url":"https:\/\/api.edinburghfestivalcity.com\/events\/ffd97a3c1ed16005d2d64126aa7211680c8bf448","updated":"2022-07-13 15:36:58","update_times":{"identity":1655116815,"title":1655116815,"description":1655116815,"venue":1657723018,"performances":1655462231,"artist":1655116815,"genre":1655116815,"discounts":1655116815,"age_category":1655116815,"fringe_first":1655116815,"other":1655116815,"disabled":1655116815,"web_links":1655116815,"images":1655116815,"status":1655116815},"latitude":55.949401,"longitude":-3.193045,"related_content":[]},{"festival_id":"fringe","title":"Ben Clover: Best Newcomer","sub_title":null,"status":"active","code":"2022BENCLOV_CHC","year":2022,"venue":{"name":"C ARTS | C venues | C piccolo","map_ref":null,"code":"34","description":"Catch up with culture at Edinburgh Press Club, an intimate caf\u00e9-cabaret space of stories on Cockburn Street.

The audience are invited to share the new-found surreal humour she deploys to find peace after bereavement.

When Samara decides to move away with her fiance, conflict arises, and the bond with her mother is put to the test. Written by Elise Marra, writer of Frankie! The Musical, Pulse creates dynamic and comedic characters to tackle serious undertones.
